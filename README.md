# Modified-Caesar-Cipher

Modified Caesar Cipher is a technique to overcome some problem in traditional caesar cipher. In this work I use a random array of same length as text to shift the alphabet. I didn't use a single value for shift.

Output Example:

Text:This is Modified Caesar Cipher

Plain Text: ThisisModifiedCaesarCipher

Random value: [6, 4, 20, 13, 11, 2, 5, 18, 20, 18, 4, 5, 7, 13, 23, 17, 19, 20, 16, 21, 26, 20, 26, 20, 11, 5]

Cipher Text: ZlcftuRgxajnlqZrxmqmCcpbpw

Decipher Text: ThisisModifiedCaesarCipher
